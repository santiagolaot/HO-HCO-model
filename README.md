# Abstract

Human behaviors in social systems are often shaped by group pressure and collective norms, especially since the rise of social media platforms. However, in the context of adopting misbehaviors, most existing contagion models rely on pairwise interactions and thus fail to capture group-level dynamics. To fill this gap, we introduce a higher-order extension of the Honesty–Corruption–Ostracism (HCO) model to study the emergence of systemic corruption in populations where individuals interact through group structures. The model incorporates contagion-like transitions mediated by hyperedges of arbitrary order, capturing the influence of peer pressure in group settings. Analytical and numerical results show that higher-order interactions induce discontinuous (explosive) transitions between fully honest and fully corrupt regimes, separated by a bistable phase. This abrupt behavior disappears in the pairwise limit, highlighting the destabilizing effect of group interactions. Furthermore, we establish a general correspondence between our model and broader classes of social contagion dynamics with symmetry breaking, recovering previous results as limiting cases. These findings underscore the critical role of higher-order structure in shaping behavioral adoption processes and the stability of social systems.
